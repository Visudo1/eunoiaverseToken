 Eunoiaverse Token (EVS) Overview


​The Eunoiaverse Token (EVS) is the foundational digital asset and utility token for the Eunoiaverse ecosystem. Deployed as a standard, fully compliant ERC-20 token on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), EVS is designed to power transactions, governance, and value accrual within the Eunoiaverse platform.


​Key Features




​Token Standard: ERC-20 (Solidity 0.8.20).


​Total Fixed Supply: The token features a strictly limited, immutable supply of 1,000,000,000 (1 Billion) EVS. This constraint is enforced at the smart contract level to maintain scarcity.


​Initial Distribution: The entire initial supply is minted (created) immediately upon contract deployment and transferred directly to the designated Initial Owner address, providing full control over the initial asset allocation.


​Ownership & Security: The contract inherits Ownable functionality, granting the deployer exclusive privileges. This structure allows the project team to manage potential future upgrades or critical functions (if implemented) with enhanced security.
